Welcome !

I am an Engineer-turned-Radio Astronomer/Solar Physicist, currently working on Space-based intrumentation and Solar eruptions. At present, I am a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) / Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). 

I am alumnus of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIAp), Bengaluru and University of Calcutta (CU), India. I did integrated M.Tech and PhD from IIA-CU in 2020 in Astronomical Intrumentation. 

Prior to GSFC, I was a postdoctoral reseacher at the Space Physics Research group with Prof. Emilia Kilpua of the University of Helsinki. I did numerical simulations of solar flux ropes and observation of solar radio bursts. 

I was a Summer Research Fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) in the summer of 2018 with Dr. Pietro Zucca. I worked on Solar imaging pipeline with the Low Frequency Array.
