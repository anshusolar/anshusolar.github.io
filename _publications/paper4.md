The angular size of the smallest, compact radio source that can be observed in the solar atmosphere is one of the intriguing questions in low-frequency radio astronomy. This is important to understand density turbulence in the solar corona and the related angular broadening of the radio source sizes. We used a two-element interferometer with a baseline length of ≈200 km, operating at ≈53 MHz to infer the above limit. Our results indicate that radio sources of angular size ≤15″ exist in the solar corona, where radio emission at the above frequency also originates.
