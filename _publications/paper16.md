  Type-IV radio bursts have been studied for over 50 years. However, the specifics of the radio emission mechanisms is still an open question. In order to provide more information about the emission mechanisms, we studied a moving Type-IV radio burst with fine structures (spike group) by using the high-resolution capability of the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) on August 25, 2014. We present a comparison of Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH) and the first LOFAR imaging data of the Type-IV radio burst. The degree of circular polarization (DCP) is calculated at frequencies in the range 20 - 180 MHz using LOFAR data, and it was found that the value of DCP gradually increased during the event, with values of 20 - 30%. LOFAR interferometric data were combined with white-light observations in order to track the propagation of this Type-IV burst. The kinematics shows a westward motion of the radio sources, slower than the CME leading edge. The dynamic spectrum of LOFAR shows a large number of fine structures with durations of less than 1 s and high brightness temperatures (TB), i.e., 1012 - 1013 K. The gradual increase of DCP supports gyrosynchrotron emission as the most plausible mechanism for the Type IV. However, coherent emissions such as Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) instability may be responsible for small-scale fine structures. Countless fine structures altogether were responsible for such high TB.
