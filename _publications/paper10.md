Solar eruptions, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are often accompanied by accelerated electrons that can in turn emit radiation at radio wavelengths. This radiation is observed as solar radio bursts. The main types of bursts associated with CMEs are type II and type IV bursts that can sometimes show movement in the direction of the CME expansion, either radially or laterally. However, the propagation of radio bursts with respect to CMEs has only been studied for individual events. Here, we perform a statistical study of 64 moving bursts with the aim to determine how often CMEs are accompanied by moving radio bursts. This is done in order to ascertain the usefulness of using radio images in estimating the early CME expansion.
