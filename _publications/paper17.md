Some of of the most prominent sources for energetic particles in our Solar System are huge eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which usually drive shocks that accelerate charged particles up to relativistic energies. In particular, energetic electron beams can generate radio bursts through the plasma emission mechanism. The main types of bursts associated with CME shocks are type II and herringbone bursts. However, it is currently unknown where early accelerated electrons that produce metric type II bursts and herringbones propagate and when they escape the solar atmosphere. Here, we investigate the acceleration location, escape, and propagation directions of electron beams during the early evolution of a strongly expanding CME-driven shock wave associated with herrinbgone bursts.
