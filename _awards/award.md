We report observations of the high frequency type II radio burst (≈430-30 MHz) that occurred in the solar corona on 2015 November 4. The drift rate of the burst, estimated close to the start frequency of its fundamental component (≈215 MHz), is unusually high (≈2 MHz s-1). Our analysis shows that the estimated speed of the magnetohydrodynamic shock driver of the burst varies with time. The peak speed and acceleration are very large, ≈ 2450 {km} {{{s}}}-1 and ≈ 17 {km} {{{s}}}-2, respectively. There is spatio-temporal correlation between the type II burst and the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) in the whitelight and extreme-ultraviolet images. The time profile of the shock speed and the light curve of the associated soft X-ray flare correlate well. These results indicate that in the present case, (I) the magnetohydrodynamic shock responsible for the high frequency coronal type II burst is driven by the CME and (II) the time profile of the type II burst shock speed represents the near-Sun kinematics of the CME.
