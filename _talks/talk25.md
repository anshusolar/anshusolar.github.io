The coronal magnetic field, the ultimate driver of space weather, plays an essential role in the formation, evolution, and dynamics of the small and large-scale structures in the solar corona. These structures may lead to gigantic explosions in the solar atmosphere in the form of large-scale eruptions, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which may severely impact near-Earth space. CMEs are often accompanied by radio emissions, which provide access to observations of the related solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric space weather phenomena. Radio techniques can provide early signatures of particle acceleration associated with solar flares and CMEs. Using radio observations and time-dependent data-driven numerical modeling of active region, we study the formation and eruption of the coronal flux ropes. I will highlight the radio techniques to constrain the initial CME properties close to the Sun and the numerical modeling approach to understanding the initiation and evolution of large-scale solar eruptions.
