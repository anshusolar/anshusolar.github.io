The solar coronal magnetic field plays an important role in the formation, evolution, and dynamics of small and large-scale structures in the corona. Estimation of the coronal magnetic field, the ultimate driver of space weather, particularly in the "low" and "middle" corona, is presently limited due to practical difficulties. Data-driven time-dependent magnetofrictional modelling (TMFM) of active region magnetic fields has been proven as a tool to observe and study the corona. In this work, we present a detailed study of data-driven TMFM of active region 12473 to trace the early evolution of the flux rope related to the coronal mass ejection that occurred on 28 December 2015. Non-inductive electric field component in the photosphere is critical for energizing and introducing twist to the coronal magnetic field, thereby allowing unstable configurations to be formed. We estimate this component using an approach based on optimizing the injection of magnetic energy. We study the effects of these optimisation parameters on the data driven coronal simulations. By varying the free optimisation parameters, we explore the changes in flux rope formation and their early evolution, as well other parameters, e.g. axial flux, magnetic field magnitude.
